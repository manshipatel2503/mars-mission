# Journey Orchestrator

## Introduction

As humanity explores the possibility of settling on Mars, the need for efficient management of interplanetary travel and colonization becomes more evident. To address this challenge, we've developed a robust application known as the "Journey Orchestrator." This platform is designed to streamline the process of mission planning and execution for Mars exploration missions.

## Core Features

1. **Mission Management**

   - **Manage Mission Page:** Displays a list of missions with features like search, sort, and filtering for easy navigation.
   - **Add Mission:** Allows users to input mission details such as mission name, destination, departure date, and crew assignments.
   - **Update Mission:** Enables users to edit existing mission details and update crew assignments as needed.

2. **Crew Management**
   - **Add Crew Members:** Provides functionality to add, update, and delete crew members associated with a mission.
   - **Validate Crew Composition:** Ensures that each mission has the required crew composition, including pilots, engineers, and passengers, with appropriate experience levels.

## Technology Stack

- **React:** The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Material-UI:** Styling is implemented using Material-UI, providing a clean and modern interface design.
- **Redux:** Mission data management is handled using Redux for efficient state management.
